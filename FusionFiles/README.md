Inside you will find the STL file for the project and a pdf containing the assembly and technical drawings

The shape of the controller was based on the vague idea of a duck: wings + head with a mouth/beak (I forget how to spell that word).  
It was shaped around the components included, namely the arduino, because of its importance and shape.  
The controller is held by just grabbing it by the button, because that is a easy to swish handle.

The other components were placed where they'd function best:  
-Vibration motor inside the print where the hand would hold it so that vibrations are transmitted properly  
-Buttons near the button for easy access from the thumb (or hand in general)  
-Gyro near the center of the body to properly read the rotation

Other small details:  
-Hole in the beak acting as a port for the arduino's micro-B port.
-Buttons would be tilted into the hole they are located within
