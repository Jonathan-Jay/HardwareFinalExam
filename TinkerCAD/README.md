Inside will a be a video showing the circuits in action and a screenshot of the circuit.

It uses 2 buttons, 1 gyro (omnidirectional tilt), and a vibration motor. Each component does something for the controller:  
-The buttons allow for active inputs, like a flap wings to go up, or dash forwards to dodge.  
-The gyro will be used for direction control as this helps with immersion when controlling a flying character (in this case a duck).  
-The vibration motor will make the game more immersive by providing haptic feedback for certain events (such as getting hit or flapping wings), to help the feel of the game experience.  

Aside: the circuit looks slightly different in the video because I didn't realize some wires were hidden. It's the exact same, just with the wires moved out of the way.
